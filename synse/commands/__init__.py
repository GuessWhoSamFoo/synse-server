"""Synse Server commands module.

This module contains the command definitions for all Synse Server
endpoints. This is where the logic for all commands are implemented.
Command functions are imported here for easier importing elsewhere,
e.g. instead of having to do 'from synse.commands.scan import scan'
you can simply 'from synse.commands import scan'.
