Synse Server built-in emulator.


This emulator is written using the Synse Go SDK. The source can be found in the
vaporio/synse-server-internal repo. This binary is compiled for linux amd64.

TODO - writeup of the emulator
TODO - figure out how the dev cycle goes here.. feels clunky to just copy/paste over the
       binary, but in theory it shouldn't be too bad because the emulator shouldn't be
       changing all that much.
