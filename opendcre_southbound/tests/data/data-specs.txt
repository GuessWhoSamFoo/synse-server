The JSON files in this directory act as test configuration data for the opendcre emulator
when running the test suites. There should be one data config file (JSON file) per test
suite. Test suites will eventually have multiple test cases within them, e.g. devicebus tests.
In these cases, ranges of board numbers should be allocated to each test case. Currently, the
ranges were chosen arbitrarily to be of length 10.

The below mapping should be updated as tests are added/removed so there is a lesser change
of one test stomping on the data for another test (though this isn't necessarily always bad).


Device bus tests:
-----------------
  0x00 - 0x09 : scan tests
  0x0a - 0x13 : version tests
  0x14 - 0x1d : read tests
  0x1e - 0x27 : power tests
  0x28 - 0x2f : chassis fan speed
  0x30 - 0x3f : chassis led
  0x40 - 0xb3 : unallocated
  0xb4 - 0xbd : bad trailer
  0xbe - 0xc7 : bad checksum
  0xc8 - 0xd1 : line noise - buffers
  0xc8 +      : leave empty


Endurance tests:
----------------
  0x00 - 0x09 : endurance test
  0x0a - 0x13 : threaded test
  0x14 - 0xb3 : unallocated
  0xb4 - 0xbd : bad trailer
  0xbe - 0xc7 : bad checksum
  0xc8 +      : leave empty


Emulator tests:
---------------
  0x00 - 0x09 : emulator counter tests
  0x0a - 0xb3 : unallocated
  0xb4 - 0xbd : bad trailer
  0xbe - 0xc7 : bad checksum
  0xc8 +      : leave empty
