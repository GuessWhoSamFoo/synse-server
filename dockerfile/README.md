This directory contains the Dockerfiles for OpenDCRE Southbound. Each Dockerfile corresponds to a different 
architecture build, which is denoted by the suffix given to the Dockerfile.
 * `arm64` - ARM64 architectures
 * `rpi` - Raspberry Pi
 * `x64` - x64 architectures
 
Note that currently, `x64` is the only supported / maintained architecture. While other builds may work or 
be made to work, they have not been actively maintained as development has centered around x64 architectures.
