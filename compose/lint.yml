#
# compose/lint.yml
#
# Compose file for linting Synse Server source code. This is
# used by the Makefile (`make lint`) to run the linting tools
# against Synse Server if Python 3.6 is not found to be installed
# locally.
#
# Running linting locally is much faster than running it via
# docker compose, so that should be the preferred method.
#
# This compose file should be called as an override to the
# `compose/test.yml` file, e.g.
#    docker-compose -f test.yml -f lint.yml up
#
version: "3"
